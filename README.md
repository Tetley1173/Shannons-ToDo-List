## Purpose of this Project
To learn how to make apps using c# and windows forms. The end goal is to have a to do list app that will store my list as well as open on windows startup. I would like to become faster at coding through this project and to learn better ways to test my projects. Also I need to learn how to best use README.md files.

## Project Requirements
Create a to do app that can store a list of things that need to be done. The list needs to be editable, its order needs to be changable, and items need to be able to be deleted. The app is to be customised to suit my personal need for a to do list with the details of the UI to be determined in an agile way as I develop my understanding of which formate will suit me the most.

## Things that are done
The app is able to dynamically add a list of rich text boxes and a button for each of them so they can be deleted. Both UI elements do not have functionality yet.

## Things to get done:
1- Get the app to store information, I could start by storing lists as text files or I can go strait for a database which will be the final solution anyway.\
2- Do a basic tidy up of the UI, change the colours back from their test colours, fix button sizing.\
3- Creat a class that handles the dynamic inclusion of new tabs as I will need at least 3 tabs with different lists in them on demand. This could potentially be hard coded at 3 but I think a dynamic system is a good coding challenge and learning opportunity.\
